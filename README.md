Isolation Forests and KMeans clustering are employed as anomaly detection in pump system, to identify deviations from normal operating patterns. By analyzing sensor data, including pressure, temperature, and flow rates, the model can effectively pinpoint anomalies or outliers, providing early warnings for potential faults or malfunctions in the pump. This tailored approach aims to reduce false negatives, enhancing the model's ability to catch actual positive cases while being mindful of potential false positives. The ultimate goal is to optimize predictive maintenance, minimize downtime, and ensure the reliable and efficient performance of the pump system.
